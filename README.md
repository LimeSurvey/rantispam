# R-Antispam

A fork of the R-Antispam component built by http://www.ratmilwebsolutions.com/

## How it works
R-Antispam is a component to block spam sent to Kunena Forum or NinjaBoard Forum. 
It uses a Bayesian algorithm to detect spam and it can be trained to improve recognition.


## How to use

Clone the repository and package it as a ZIP file, or download the current ZIP directly.
Install it as a normal component in the Joomla Administration using the ZIP file.

## Changes to original version

* Fixed the kunena integration to work with kunena 5
